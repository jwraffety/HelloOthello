OhWhello

This is an implementation of mutliple search algorithms to solve the game of Othello for 4x4, 5x5, 6x6, 7x7 and, partially, 8x8 boards. This program uses minimax and alpha-beta pruning with various heuristics to make solving the board quick enough to not time out (10 seconds to solve the next move for the AI). The AI is contained in jwr2131_ai.py, and the rest of the supporting files are not my own: they are code provided to facilitate the functionings of jwr2131_ai.py.

To call on the AI, at runtime specify 'jwr2131_ai.py' while running othello_gui.py
